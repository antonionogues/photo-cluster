# PhotoCluster

UI demo (static preview) for LinkedIn/portfolio purposes.

## GitHub Pages (recommended)

This repo includes a GitHub Pages workflow that publishes a **static preview** of the UI (no backend / no processing).

After you push this repo to GitHub and Pages deploys, your link will be:

`https://<github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

### How to publish

1. Push to GitHub (public or private + Pages enabled).
2. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → GitHub Actions**
3. Wait for the workflow **Deploy to GitHub Pages** to finish.

## Notes

- The GitHub Pages site is intentionally **read-only**: it’s just to show the interface.
- The real app requires the backend (upload/processing/results endpoints) running locally or on a server.
